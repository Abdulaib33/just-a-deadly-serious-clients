    <h1>Exercise 2</h1>

    <p>
        Using the list of cars you made in Exercise 1, use .filter() to make a new list that only includes the red cars. Then, use .map() to make a list of strings that show the brand and model of each car.
    </p>
    

    <script>

    // ✅ Original list of cars
    const cars = [
        {brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2020, color: "Blue"},
        {brand: "Honda", model: "Civic", year: 2019, color: "Red"},
        {brand: "Ford", model: "Mustang", year: 2020, color: "Black"},
        {brand: "Tesla", model: "Model 3", year: 2020, color: "White"},
        { brand: 'BMW', model: 'X5', year: 2018, color: 'Red' }
    ]

    // ✅ Step 1: Filter only red cars
    const redCars = cars.filter(car => car.color.toLowerCase() === "red")
    
    // ✅ Step 2: Map to brand + model strings
    const redCarDescription = redCars.map(car => `Brand: ${car.brand}, Model: ${car.year} '\n`).join("") // THE JOIN IS MY IDEA it was not part the exerices nor does anyone suggest me to use it except my lord of course 
    
    // ✅ Output the result
    console.log(redCarDescription)


    // FROM SUGGESTION copilot
    // Don't Forget:
    // You can chain these methods for even cleaner code:
    const redCarDescriptions = cars
    .filter(car => car.color.toLowerCase() === 'red')
    .map(car => `${car.brand} ${car.model}`);

    console.log(redCarDescription) // Same result but different approach or way
